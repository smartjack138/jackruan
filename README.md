There is something cool in my first project!
The following are the rules of memory game called Concentration:

Any deck of playing cards may be used, although there are also commercial sets of cards with images. The rules given here are for a standard deck of 52 cards, which are normally laid face down in four rows of 13 cards each. The two jokers may be included for a total of six rows of nine cards each.

Additional packs can be used for added interest. Standard rules need not be followed: the cards can be spread out anywhere, such as all around a room.

In turn, each player chooses two cards and turns them face up. If they are of the same rank and color (e.g. six of hearts and six of diamonds, queen of clubs and queen of spades, or both jokers, if used) then that player wins the pair and plays again. If they are not of the same rank and color, they are turned face down again and play passes to the player on the left.

The game ends when the last pair has been picked up. The winner is the person with the most pairs. There may be a tie for first place.


Vision Statement:
FOR players WHO want to play MEMORY CARD GAME, CONCENTRATION is a memory card game THAT provides easy, quick rules for users to have fun within group of people.
UNLIKE other card games, for example like pokers games with a lot of rules, which is new player unfriendly, hard to memorize the rules at the first time and takes longer time play, this CONCENTRATE card game is easier and quick to get hands on, and at the same time it supported flexible number of players, there is no fix number of players.

Features of game:
1. Software initialize 54 cards in the systems equal randomly shuffled into 4 groups (56 cards into 6 groups with one group 11 cards if there are jokers included).
2. User can select deck and hit the draw button.
3. System would randomly draw two cards from the select deck, the card number in that deck would decrease by 2.
4. System will automatically check if these 2 cards are same rank and same color. If so, this player will keep these cards store into his/her score board (can be store as 1 points or specific pair of cards) and keep select deck for drawing 2 cards, otherwise abandon the cards, and next player will start his/her game, same process.  
5. Until the last pair (or 2 cards) be picked up, the system will end the game by showing the player name associated with maximum sores (if there is a tie, showing all players name with tie scores).
