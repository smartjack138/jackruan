There is something cool in my first project!
The following are the rules of memory game called Concentration:

1. Player select how many pair of cards they want in the game to the system.
2. Then the system will create corresponding cards faced down on the user interface.
3. When game begin, user will select two cards, and system will show if two cards are paired, if paired, system will remove these two cards, ask the same player to select another two cards, if not, two cards will be faced down again, pass it to another player.
4. When all cards have been selected and paired, and there is no card showing on the interface, game over.
5. System counting the player who has the most of pairs wins. Then showing the leaderboard.  

Vision Statement:
FOR players WHO want to play MEMORY CARD GAME and train their memory ability, CONCENTRATION is a memory card game THAT provides easy, quick rules for users to have fun within multiple players.
UNLIKE other card games, for example like pokers games with a lot of rules, which is new player unfriendly, hard to memorize the rules at the first time and takes longer time play, this CONCENTRATE card game is easier and quick to get hands on, and at the same time it supported flexible number of players, there is no fix number of players.

Features of game:
1. Software initialize shuffled cards faced down put on the user interface in distributed rows.
2. Select and flip two cards based on choice.
3. Add scores to the player if cards are same rank and color, at same time these 2 cards be removed from interface, otherwise cards would be flipped back faced down and pass to another player.
4. Until the last pair (or 2 cards) be flipped up, the system will end the game by showing the player name associated with maximum sores (if there is a tie, showing all players name with tie scores).
5. Card history in last around, which means each player can see his/her which card (not paired) he or she has flipped with the last around but there is no position info for those cards.
6. Chat function allows each player can chat through either chat box or they can turn on their video or voice.
7. Ranking system, based on win/lost, player would receive corresponding credits, every sort amount of credits can give them a level.
8. Change background of cards, players can change to any picture or color.
9. Matching system, players can find players through their prefer locations, rankings.
